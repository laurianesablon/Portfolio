# Metrople

I want to do a game about the parisian metro system. Either a game where the user has to find as much subway stations as they can. Or a game where the user has to find the best itinerary to go from one station to an other. Maybe both? I'll see. This is my first real autonomous React project, i cannot wait to see how it will turn out.
